# Hi &#128075;, I'm Alberto
I'm a *Full-Stack software developer* with a strong interest in security topics, expecially, regarding applications of *cryptography*.

I've a Master's degree in Mathematics, curriculum *Cryptography and Coding Theory*, and an high-school diploma as a *computer technician*. This course of studies offered me both *practical and theoretical abilities* in front of *real-world problems*.

I'm currently working remotely and I'm based in Italy.

I have been programming since I was 13, during high school I attended at the national competition of the Italian Olympiad of Informatics and Olympiad of Problem Solving (as you can see [here](https://www.targatocn.it/2015/09/19/leggi-notizia/argomenti/scuole-e-corsi/articolo/due-studenti-dellitis-di-cuneo-qualificati-alle-finali-nazionali-delle-olimpiadi-di-informatica.html) and [here](https://www.targatocn.it/2013/05/11/leggi-notizia/argomenti/scuole-e-corsi/articolo/ottimi-risultati-per-gli-studenti-dellitis-delpozzo-nellinformatica.html)).

When I am not coding, I like reading, biking and trekking.
